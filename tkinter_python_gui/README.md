# Tkinter Python GUI Example - US City Weather Forecaster

Tkinter is a Python module used to create cross-platform GUIs.  USWeatherForecast.py demonstrates an example of a Tkinter application.

## How it works:
1. Run the script `USWeatherForecast.py` by typing either:
    ```bash
    python3 USWeatherForecast.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python USWeatherForecast.py
    ```
2. A window will pop up that looks like the following screen:

From this screen, enter in a US city name and click the "Get Weather" button.

3. The interface should update to display a table with the city's weather information.
