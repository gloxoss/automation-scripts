# Image encoder and decoder

This script helps you to encode any image files to base64 and vise versa.

## How to use it ?

### To encode


Just Put the image files inside `encode_image/` directory, then run the script using `python encode_img.py`, it will create a base64 uri text file `encoded.txt` in the root directory.

### To decode


Just Put the base64 text inside the `base64_image.txt` file , then run the script using `python decode_img.py`, it will create a iamge file `decoded_image.png` in the root directory.

## Have fun with the script !! ^^
