## Disclaimers

>Refrain from using this library if you are trying to query  the stock exchange very very frequently. It increases load on BSE’s servers and might even lead to your IP address being blacklisted by them. Apart from the technical issues, it’s higly unethical.
 For frequent queries, consider buying data from BSE or a vendor. More details are available [here](https://www.bseindia.com/market_data_products.html)
