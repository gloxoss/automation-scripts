# Email Validator

Feature-rich email verification service helping to reduce email bounce, improve email deliverability and increase marketing ROI.

## Features

There are several advanced metrics to help you make informed decisions. Some of these are listed here:

* **Role email address detection:** Role addresses are not associated with a person. Instead, they represent a group, department or role. Example: ```sales@yahoo.com```
* **Disposable email detection:** Detects temporarily created email addresses. Example: ```example@mailinator.com```
* **Free email validator:** The email address is flagged accordingly if it uses a known free email service like Gmail, AOL, Hotmail etc.
* **Email typo correction:** If the address a user keyed in has typos, the built-in auto correction feature suggests the correct email to end users when a domain is spelled incorrectly.
* **MX Record Detection**
* **MX Domain Detection**
* **Strong encryption for complete security.**
