@shivambzt @gsoc @pybamm_ @robertwtimms @tinosulzer @brosaplanella Sure @shivambzt! It would be tough to debug it here but I'll try, or if you think there is an issue/bug with the installation, you can create a new issue/discussion here - https://t.co/gdq9IhH1lI

Vacationing after 3 years!

Second and the last week of "no-code".

I spent the last week studying maths (linear algebra and multivariable calculus), but I realised, I was still using my laptop 24x7.

This week no laptop, and no code. 

I'll probably explore all the beaches ü§© https://t.co/s8XXYbqgAX

Also, the final project (the bot) is available here - @battbot_ üîã
===============================================================
@gsoc is finally over, and the summer went beyond my expectationsü§ñ.
I'll be working with @pybamm_ more, but after a short breaküå¥.
Finally, a special thanks to my mentors, couldn't have done this without them - @robertwtimms, @tinosulzer, @brosaplanellaüòÑ

@bcjanmay @robertwtimms @battbot_ @pybamm_ The bot, right now, is not tweeting any GIF with degradation mechanisms "on", as they are under active development. My account on the other hand is a testing area for these tweets so you might see some weird GIFs in the future tooüòÖ

Week 5 and 6 blog, covering the process of making the bot completely independent, is up! Also, check out @battbot_ for some fun tweetsüîãü§ñ

It‚Äôs always so exciting to read about the groundbreaking discoveries in science, and using Open Source Softwares make them even more exciting!

My favourite one will be the Nobel Prize use case (always been a fan of Physics, Astrophysics and Space).

Also, @pybamm_ is thereüòÑü•≥ https://t.co/nAUoODagtG
