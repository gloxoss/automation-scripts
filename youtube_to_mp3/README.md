## Youtube video downloader and mp4 to mp3 converter

This script provides the audio version of a BGM, speech, song/music in mp3 format. One has to only paste the link of the YouTube video
that they want ot convert. A little help from my side for those who like hearing music/songs or speech as audiobooks that are only found
on Youtube! It uses two libraries and one module. 

Instructions:
1. Download pytube library using CLi with the command: pip install pytube 
2. Download moviepy library using CLi with the command: pip install moviepy 
2. Run the script 
4. Here by default it is saved in C drive in Downloads. But you may change the path to your desired destination by modifying the
   path in SAVE_PATH variable.
5. The user has to paste the file name from the list to further convert it to .mp3 format in case if multiple files with .mp4 format
   are found in the directory. It also asks for the itag giving the user independence to choose the resolution and quality of the
   audio to be downloaded from the streams that are available for further converting it to .mp3 format.
