# This is a Python Script which shoots you a reminder every 20 mins to take a break from screen and blink your eyes for 20 seconds looking at an object 20 feet away : 20-20-20 rule for Dry Eyes.


## Requirements

For this script to run you need to have playsound package installed


```python
pip3 install playsound
```

Copy any media file which you want to run as the reminder sound and replace it in the playsound args. Currently it is set as "danger.mp3" which is a local file in my working directory.


To run the script, use the following command

``` python
python3 eye_blink_reminder.py
```
